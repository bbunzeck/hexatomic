# Deleting annotations

You can delete annotations in two different ways:

1. Set an empty annotation value in one or more cells. This works regardless of whether you edit a single cell, or multiple cells at once.
2. Select one or more annotation cells, and then  
   A. either press the <kbd>Del</kbd> key, or  
   B. right-click with the mouse and select **Delete cell(s)** from the context menu.
   This menu item will only be available when deleting the selected cells is possible.

After you have deleted one or more annotations, one or more spans could be left without any annotations.
In this case, these spans will also be deleted.
