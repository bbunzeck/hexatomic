# Editing the grid

You can edit the corpus document in the grid in different ways.

1. You can change the **values** of annotations. In this case, the namespace and name of the annotations stay the same.
2. You can **rename** annotations, that is, change their namespace and/or name. In this case, the annotations' value stays the same.
3. You can delete annotations. In this case, the whole annotation is removed.

You can read how to do these things in the following sections.
