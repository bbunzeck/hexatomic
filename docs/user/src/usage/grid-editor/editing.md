# Editing values in the grid

You can edit the values of annotations by

1. clicking on the respective cell, or
2. pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>.

Both actions will activate the editor. Type in the new annotation value and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to commit the new value.

## Editing multiple values at once

You can edit multiple values at once. To do so, select more than one cell (see [*Navigation and selection*](index.html#navigation-and-selection)), and press <kbd>Space</kbd>. This will bring up a window where you can enter the new value, and commit it by clicking **OK**, or pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You can abort the edit by clicking **Cancel**, or pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
