## Versioning

Hexatomic adheres to [**Semantic Versioning 2.0.0**](https://semver.org).

Versions take the form of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR` versions are *incompatible* with each other. `MAJOR` is incremented, when an incompatible API change is introduced.
- `MINOR` versions add "features", i.e., backwards-compatible functionality.
- `PATCH` versions add backwards-compatible bug fixes.

`TODO Include internal versioning information, e.g., for different plugins/features.`
